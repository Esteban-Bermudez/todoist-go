# todoist-go

A Go wrapper for the new [Todoist API](https://developer.todoist.com/). 
This library is a **work in progress**, intended to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with Todoist from Go.

> ⚠️ Currently supports the [old](https://developer.todoist.com/rest/v2#overview) **REST API** only. Future support for other endpoints is planned

---

## Disclaimer

This is a personal side project — I’m slowly working through the Todoist API. There’s still lots to do, but I hope this wrapper will eventually make working with Todoist in Go much easier.

---

## Getting Started

_Coming soon._ Basic usage examples and setup instructions will be added as the API wrapper becomes more complete.

---

## Roadmap

- ✅ Implement old REST API found [here](https://developer.todoist.com/rest/v2#overview)
- 📚 Add support for new endpoints inside the old REST API (new endpoints inside tasks, projects etc)
- 🛠 Begin implementing the **Sync API**
- ⏳ Expand support to new endpoints

## Features & Endpoint Coverage

For the most accurate and up-to-date information on which endpoints have been implemented or are still pending, please refer to the Go documentation:

👉 [GoDoc Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Esteban-Bermudez/todoist-go)

The wrapper currently targets the legacy REST API. Support for the Sync API is planned in future updates.
